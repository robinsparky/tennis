/**
* Match tie-break
    * This is sometimes played instead of a third set. A match tie-break (also called super tie-break) is played like a regular tie-break, 
    * but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. 
    * Match tie-breaks are used in the Hopman Cup, Grand Slams (excluding Wimbledon) and the Olympic Games for mixed doubles; 
    * on the ATP (since 2006), WTA (since 2007) and ITF (excluding four Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play.

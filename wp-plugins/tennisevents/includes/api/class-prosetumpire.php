* Pro set
    * Instead of playing multiple sets, players may play one "pro set". 
    * A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. 
    * A 12-point tie-break is usually played when the score is 8–8 (or 10–10). These are often played with no-ad scoring.

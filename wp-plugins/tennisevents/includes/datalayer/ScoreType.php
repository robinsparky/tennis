/**
* TennisMatch scoring:
* No ad
    * A popular alternative to advantage scoring is "no-advantage" (or "no-ad") scoring, created by James Van Alen in order to shorten match playing time.
    * No-advantage scoring is a scoring method in which the first player to reach four points wins the game. 
    * No-ad scoring eliminates the requirement that a player must win by two points. 
    * Therefore, if the game is tied at deuce, the next player to win a point wins the game. 
    * This method of scoring is used in most World TeamTennis matches.
    * When this style of play is implemented, at deuce, the receiver then chooses from which side of the court he or she desires to return the serve. 
    * However, in no-ad mixed doubles play, each gender always serves to the same gender at game point and during the final point of tiebreaks.
* Pro set
    * Instead of playing multiple sets, players may play one "pro set".
    * A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. 
    * A 12-point tie-break is usually played when the score is 8–8 (or 10–10). 
    * These are often played with no-ad scoring.
* TennisMatch tie-break
    * This is sometimes played instead of a third set. 
    * A match tie-break (also called super tie-break) is played like a regular tie-break, 
    * but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. 
    * TennisMatch tie-breaks are used in the Hopman Cup, Grand Slams (excluding Wimbledon) and the Olympic Games for mixed doubles; 
    * on the ATP (since 2006), WTA (since 2007) and ITF (excluding four Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play.
* Fast4
    * Fast4 is a shortened format that offers a "fast" alternative, with four points, four games and four rules: 
    * there are no advantage scores, lets are played, tie-breakers apply at three games all and the first to four games wins the set.
